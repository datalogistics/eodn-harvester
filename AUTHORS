EODNHarvester is a daemon that gathers scenes from the United States Geological 
Survey (USGS) using the USGS JSON interface. The USGS hosts satellite imagery 
collected by a number of sensors. These images (a collection of images of a 
single location - e.g. Standard and Infared - is called a scene) are uploaded 
to the Earth Observation Depot Network (EODN) for use and data collection.
EODNHarvester was created by the Indiana University Center for Research in 
Extreme Scale Technologies (CREST) in Bloomington, Indiana in collaboration
with Stephen F. Austin State University.
